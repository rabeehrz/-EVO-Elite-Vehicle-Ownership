==============================

Elite Vehicle Ownership is a vehicle ownersihip system made from scratch for the San Andreas MultiPlayer platform (SA:MP).

This project started in 2016 as a hobby of mine when I was in the final year of my Highschool. The original forum thread can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190424072005/https://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=615531).

This project is now open source. This script is written in [PAWN](https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm) language.
